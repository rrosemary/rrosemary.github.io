Honestly, the taste for us (me, actually) is more of an acquired taste. Which means, the love for pineapple didnТt come naturally. I had to acquire it over time.Ф You may disagree totally or you and I may just be alike. Either way, since this fruit is quite popular, it is always worth talking about some interesting pineapple facts.

If that sounds good to you, here are some recipes with whole, healthy foods and smart substitutes so you can have your cheesecake and eat it too.
